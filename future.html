             I played multiple games since then, on multiple different platforms, all with very different graphic styles. Mobile games tended to have a fantasy or minimal style, while PC games still strive to achieve photo realism. Fantasy styles are graphics that are very different from our world and tend to look like very ornate versions of vector graphics and exaggerating any pleasing feature

	<h1>How will game graphics affect developers now and in the future?</h1>
        <p>
        Game development has attracted many technologists from all areas of science due to its appeal to consumers and the multi-billion dollar industry that runs it. However, most of the spotlight and the cash that consumers put into games went to the studios established during the 1990s and 2000s, when the race for photorealism had started. Today, the race still continues. However, it takes an exponential amount of time and money to make games with even more photorealistic graphics, since developers have almost achieved the peak of life-like graphics. In the 2010s, the gaming industry took a huge shift as consumers invested billions of dollars into mobile gaming. People preferred to play game on portable devices which do not have the graphical power required to play the realistic modern games played on PC and consoles. As a result, most mobile games have much simpler and non realistic graphics, with much more focus on gameplay and any story the game might involve. This led to a shift in concentration of interest for games. Mobile gamers are gamers who play games with pleasing graphics and are easy to understand. These games are also cheaper to make and cost much less to buy. Due to appeal of simplicity, mobile gaming has a much wider audience and required much less investment to have a good time. PC and console gamers, on the other hand, tend to invest much more and play games that require a lot of resources to make. Even though there is a lower range of demographic on the PC/console gaming side, the demand for photorealism still exists and is a driving force for most large studio developers.
