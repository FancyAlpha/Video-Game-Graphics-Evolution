            It was a very primitive game that still obeyed the laws of physics. Remember, it was made during a time when video games were considered useless.

        <p>
        Fast forwarding to the release of SpaceWar! In 1961, SpaceWar! Was one of the first very successful video games and was developed by MIT after it received a DEC PDP-1 computer. It was a 2D, 8-bit game where a player would control one of 2 spaceships and would gravitate around a central star, trying to shoot down the other player. It was very popular within the university and proved to be the pioneer of video game graphics since it inspired a whole lot of developers to make other games.
