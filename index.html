            The very first computer games weren't even "video" games at all.  They were text-based games that used words to describe scenes for the reader and allowed them to choose their actions.

	<h1>How have video game graphics developed and affected developers?</h1>
        <p>
         This website explores the history of video game graphics and the changes in developing video game graphics. The development of graphics co relates to the development of hardware (namely, video card development). The gaming industry was not established yet during the 1960s and game development was slow. Video game graphics did not progress much and most games were just 8 bit or 16 bit 2 dimensional games. Once the video graphical power required to make 3D games with 64 bit resolution was commonly available, developers were able to work independently, giving rise to multiple styles of game graphics and expanding the game development community.
