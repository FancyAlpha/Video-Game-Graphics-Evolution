            Doom the gory game was the pioneer of first-person shooter games. It and Quake were developed by id Software and used sprites a lot.

         It isn't until the 1990s when much more advanced games arrive like Mortal Kombat, Doom, Quake, Warcraft, etc., when the gaming business booms and introduces a whole lot more graphical innovation in terms of hardware improvements. By this time, game graphics and the hardware that renders it have improved significantly, transitioning from 8 bit to 16 bit and then 64 bit with a 3D world where the player can travel through all 3 dimensions. During this time, a race emerged to create the most realistic 3D world simulation with fictional elements like monsters trying to shoot players down. Realism required accurate textures for the 3d world, which meant that developers had to move away from vector graphics and use raster graphics and sprites. As, the race for higher and higher graphics continued, developers realized that every time a game is made, they had to remake the sprites, raster graphics, and the physics behind the game. Here came the Physics Engines during the 21st century. Physics engines were programs that could simulate 3D or 2D environments commonly used in games at the time, which means that developers could use the same engines and not reinvent the wheel (they don't have to make the entire game from scratch again). Now, developers could focus on the story and the graphics of the game, greatly increasing the quality of games during the 2000s.
